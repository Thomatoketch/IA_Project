projet IA

Task 1 : 
3) number of training samples : 50000 
number of test samples : 10000
4) shape of each image : 32x32x3 (taille de l'image L*l*profondeur(3 pour les images couleurs RGB))
channel color : 3 RGB

Task 2 :
2) The label of data represents its name.
the label is numerical.
3) very blur for humans
it depends of the label but a major part is easy to recognize for humans

Task 3 :
2) It help stabalize the data and make it easier to use for the model and converge faster to the optimal solution.
3) same same
4) faster training, highter accuracy and reduce sensityvity to initial weights
